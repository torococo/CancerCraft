Immune{

  Types{
    Requires Antigen and MHC{
      intrinsically damages body
      Enhanced by Anibody{
        nut cheap Scouts{
      DendriticCells(collect antigen, detects cancer)
        }
        nut cheap Infantry{
      Neutrophil(fast grunts)
        }
        Tanks{
          Engulph and aoe damage{
      nut medium Macrophage(releases oxygen reactive species, can also eat antibody marked cells)
      nut expensive antigen light Basophyl(extreme Macrophage, immune to Anti-Inflamatory)
      nut expensive antigen med Eosinophil(exteme Basophyl, immune to Anti-Inflamatory)
          }

        nut+antigen Antibody producers{
      B_Cell(produces antibody, which binds to Cancer Cells, upgrades to MALT at blood vessel)

    Require Antibody{
        expensive Drone Strike{
      T_Cell(kills antibody bound cells)

    expensive nut, no antigen Require any{
      NKCells(kills only? cells that are missing MHC class 1)
    }
    Interleukin8(inflamation signal)
  }
  Treatment{
    if body damage goes beyond threshold, treatments are introduced?
